        <p>Highlighting the trend at a webinar organized by social organization Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR), officials at National Health Mission UP believe that the decline is expected to show up as a higher number of child births over the next one year. On an average, 5.5 million babies are born in UP each year.
“Now as a result of this, naturally, more babies will be born next year,” said Dr Alpana Sharma, general manager, family planning, NHM UP. In addition to this, a UNICEF report released ahead of Mother’s Day in May projected that an estimated 4.1 million new moms in Uttar Pradesh will have to face the challenges created by strained health systems and medical supply chains on account of global pandemic Covid-19.</p>
